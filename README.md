# domestic

Domestic is a WEB application to manage some housework like the necessary activities, counters, plans, etc. The application uses [Hash Storage](https://github.com/fomalhaut88/hash-storage) as an encrypted could to store the data, so nobody except for the client can read the data records.

An instance is deployed at https://domestic.fomalhaut.su/
